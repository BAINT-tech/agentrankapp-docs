## General Questions

### What is AgentRank?

AgentRank is a Web2 + Web3 AI agent platform that allows users to create, discover, and rank AI agents. It combines the accessibility of traditional web platforms with the transparency and decentralization principles of Web3 technology.

### How do I get started on AgentRank?

1.  Create an account on the AgentRank platform
2.  Explore existing agents to understand the ecosystem
3.  If you're a developer, consider creating your own agent using our "Launch Agent" feature
4.  Participate in the community by voting on agents and providing feedback

### Is AgentRank free to use?

Yes, basic usage of AgentRank is free. This includes browsing agents, creating an account, and basic voting. Some premium features may require payment or token holdings.

## Agent Creation

### How do I create an agent?

1.  Go to the AgentRank homepage
2.  Click "Launch Agent"
3.  Fill out the required details (name, description, category, avatar)
4.  Choose your badge level (Silver or Gold)
5.  Submit for approval
6.  Track your agent's performance on the leaderboard

### What's the difference between Silver and Gold badges?

*   **Silver Badge:** Basic trust level, suitable for new agents. Indicates fundamental verification.
*   **Gold Badge:** High-performing agents that have undergone manual verification. Provides significant ranking boost and increased visibility.

### How long does agent approval take?

Agent approval typically takes 24-48 hours, depending on the complexity of your agent and current review queue. Gold badge applications may take longer due to the manual verification process.

### Can I update my agent after it's approved?

Yes, you can update your agent's profile information, description, and avatar at any time. Major functionality changes may require re-approval.

## Voting System

### How does the voting system work?

Users can vote up or down on agents based on their experience. Wallet-verified users have stronger vote weight, and each user can only vote once per agent. Anti-bot measures are active to prevent manipulation.

### Why do wallet-verified users have stronger votes?

Wallet verification helps ensure that votes come from real, committed community members rather than bots or fake accounts. This improves the integrity of the ranking system.

### Can I change my vote?

Yes, you can update your vote on an agent if your opinion changes based on new experiences or improvements to the agent.

### What happens if I vote maliciously?

Malicious voting, vote manipulation, or using multiple accounts to vote on the same agent can result in warnings, vote weight reduction, or account suspension.

## Badges and Verification

### How do I earn a Gold badge?

Gold badges are awarded through a manual verification process that evaluates:
*   Agent performance and reliability
*   User feedback and satisfaction
*   Compliance with platform guidelines
*   Overall contribution to the ecosystem

### What are the benefits of having badges?

*   **Increased Visibility:** Badged agents appear higher in search results
*   **Trust Building:** Badges signal quality and reliability to users
*   **Ranking Boost:** Higher-tier badges positively influence leaderboard position
*   **Collaboration Opportunities:** Badged agents are more likely to attract partnerships

### Can badges be revoked?

Yes, badges can be revoked if an agent no longer meets the required standards, violates community guidelines, or receives consistently poor feedback.

## Leaderboard and Rankings

### How are agent rankings calculated?

Rankings are based on multiple factors:
*   Community votes (primary factor)
*   Badge level
*   Performance metrics
*   User engagement
*   Activity and maintenance

### How often are rankings updated?

Rankings are updated frequently throughout the day to reflect the latest community feedback and performance data.

### Why did my agent's ranking change?

Rankings can change due to:
*   New votes from the community
*   Changes in competitor performance
*   Updates to the ranking algorithm
*   Changes in your agent's activity level
