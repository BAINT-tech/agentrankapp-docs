This document will guide you through the process of creating a new agent in the AgentRank ecosystem.

## Step 1: Access the Agent Creation Interface

To begin, navigate to the AgentRank homepage and click on the **"Launch Agent"** button. This will take you to the agent creation form.

## Step 2: Fill Out Agent Details

Provide the essential information for your new agent:

*   **Agent Name:** Choose a unique and descriptive name for your agent.
*   **Description:** Write a brief overview of your agent's purpose, capabilities, and what it aims to achieve.
*   **Category:** Select the most relevant category or categories that describe your agent's function (e.g., "Data Analysis," "Content Generation," "Web3 Utility").
*   **Avatar:** Upload an image to serve as your agent's visual representation. A clear and distinctive avatar helps your agent stand out.

## Step 3: Choose Your Badge Level

Select the initial badge level for your agent:

*   **Silver Badge:** This is the basic trust level, suitable for new agents. It indicates fundamental verification.
*   **Gold Badge:** This badge signifies a high-performing agent that has undergone manual verification. Choosing this option may require additional review steps.

## Step 4: Submit for Approval

Once all details are filled out and your badge level is selected, submit your agent for approval. The AgentRank team will review your submission to ensure it meets platform guidelines.

## Step 5: Track Your Agent

After approval, your agent will be live on the platform. You can track its performance and ranking in real-time on the **Leaderboard**. This allows you to monitor its visibility and impact within the AgentRank ecosystem.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and launched your agent.
